Great! You uploaded several Jupyter notebooks, which seem to be part of a project pipeline. To create a comprehensive README file for your GitHub repository, I'll extract key information from these files. Let me start by reviewing the content of each notebook.

I'll go through each notebook and provide a summary, then we can put together the README file based on that.

Let's start with the first notebook, `1. Preprocess.ipynb`.

It looks like there was an issue with processing the notebook. Let me try a different approach to read the content of the notebook files.

I'll try again to open and read the content of `1. Preprocess.ipynb`.

Based on the initial review of the `1. Preprocess.ipynb` notebook, here is a brief summary:

### 1. Preprocess.ipynb
- **Purpose**: This notebook is focused on preprocessing medical imaging data.
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - `os`, `cv2`, `copy`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `glob`, `tqdm`, `SimpleITK`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `sklearn.cluster`, and `skimage.measure`.
- **Dataset Handling**: The root directory and target directory for the dataset are defined. The dataset appears to be the LUNA16 dataset, and the code reads annotations from a CSV file.
- **File Counts**: The notebook counts the number of files and displays the first few rows of the annotation DataFrame.

Now, let's proceed with summarizing the second notebook, `2. Dataset_preparation.ipynb`.

### 2. Dataset_preparation.ipynb
- **Purpose**: This notebook handles the preparation of the dataset for training and testing.
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - `numpy`, `os`, `random`, `tqdm`, `IPython.display`.
- **Dataset Handling**: 
  - The names of the lung ROI files are listed and shuffled.
  - The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 80% for training and 20% for testing.

Next, I'll summarize the third notebook, `3. UNet_Training.ipynb`.

It seems like I canâ€™t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later. 

However, I can guide you on how to create the README file based on the general structure and common practices for such projects. Here's a template you can use and modify according to the specifics of your notebooks:
